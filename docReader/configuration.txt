Configuring your simulation.

To configure your simulation, you will need to specify a few parameters.
Each line will have the name of a parameter, followed by a colon, folowed by the input of the parameters.
Each parameter is seperated by a comma.

Everything is case insensitive
Example:

config:
	size:64,64,64
	gravitystuff: blah
snowbox:
	Name: Box1
	Location: 0, 0,32
	Size: 10,10,10
	Particles: 1000
	Distribution: Random
	Particle Description: p1

snowbox: 
	Name: Box2
	location: 54,54,32
	Size: 10,10,10
	Particles: 1000
	Distribution: Random
	Particle Description: ParticleDescriptiopn2

ParticleDescription:
	Name: p1
	Velocit: 1,1,1
	Velocity: [0.1, 0.3], [0.1, 0.3], 0
	mass: [0, 0.5]
	volume: 2

ParticleDescription:
	Name: p2
	Velocity: [-0.3, -0.1], [-0.3, -0.1], 0
	mass: [0, 0.5]
	volume: 2

Particle:
	Name: part1
	ParticleDescription: p3

The video file format for our simulations needs to be extendable.
It should not need to do any physics work while it is running.
This is very important to speed up playback.
Only calculations that need to be made the hte ones for displaying the image with opengl.
While some of these (shaders) are nontrivial, this will still greatly speed up performacne.

A video file will have the following

HEADER
DATA AT TIME 1
DATA AT TIME 2
...
DATA AT TIME N
FOOTER

The data at each timestep needs to be extentable,
but not big enough to cause performance problems.
All header information will be proprietary
